I have to admit that when I started on this book, it's a bit hard for me to comprehend some paragraphs since there are some new words that I hadn't known before.

But after the first few chapters, I got to know most of the new words, and started to enjoyed this book.

I can also feel her inner struggle trying to find herself through education while I have to admit that when I started on this book, it's a bit hard for me to comprehend some paragraphs since there are some new words that I hadn't known before.
