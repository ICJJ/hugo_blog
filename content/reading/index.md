I have to admit that when I started on this book, it's a bit hard for me to comprehend some paragraphs since there are some new words that I hadn't known before. I often took my eyes off the pages and check the dictionary on my smartphone, which interrupted the flow of reading and was irritating. 


But after the first few chapters, I got to know most of the new words, and started to enjoyed this book. Tara Westover has a talent at story-telling. With her vivid writing, I can image myself standing in front of their house in rural Idaho, surrounded by snowy mountains, looking at the junk yard where she, her brothers, and her father worked at. I can also feel her inner struggle trying to find herself through education while felt betraying  her family.

Westover family home, Clifton, Idaho.

Since it's a memoir, all the characters in this book exist, although Tara hide real names of her parents and the brother who had bullied her. Readers would wander who are they in real life and their latest status, either do I. 
I googled and foud some interesting facts about her family. Three of the seven children in her family obtained PhDs in their fields, even though they had never set their feet in schools. 
Her mother LaRee had also written multiple books, some on herbalism and one memoir to defend the family against Tara's accusations in Educated. These are not as popular as Tara's book, but this proves that LaRee has received very good education when she was young, but
she choose to be an obedient wife, standing by her radical husband.
